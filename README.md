Built with [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) and Go.

This project uses SQLite with [sqlc](https://sqlc.dev/) for type-safe SQL code generation and [golang-migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate) for database migrations.

To display human readable time, the project use the [timediff](https://github.com/mergestat/timediff) package.

The package [godotenv](github.com/joho/godotenv) is also used to load environment variable.

The SQLite driver is [modernc/sqlite](https://pkg.go.dev/modernc.org/sqlite)
